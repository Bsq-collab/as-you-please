  class MergeSortTester

  ALGORITHM:
  1. if the array length is less than or equal to 1, return the array. (base case for recursion; an array of length one is already sorted). 
  2. If the length is greater than one, split the array into two, then sort each half(using the same method, so this method is recursive).
  3. MergeSort.merge your two halves together, which will take your two halves, which are both sorted, and combine them to make a sorted whole. 

  BIG-OH CLASSIFICATION OF ALGORITHM:
               O(nlogn)

  Mean execution times for dataset of size n: 
  Batch size: <# of times each dataset size was run>
  n=1       time: 1
  n=10      time: 
  n=100     time: 
  ...
  n=<huge>  time:
